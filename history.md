### The history of this course material
This course originated from the Combine materials
and was generously made available for our use.   
However, like most taught materials in fast-moving fields,
our usage has evolved and we have had ideological and
peadgogical changes in how we deliver the material and its
content.   
One area concerns the usage of EdgeR vs. using DESeq.
Another concerns employing pre-constructed .Rmd files
compared to the 'live-coding' teaching promoted by
the Carpentries (Software & Data).
